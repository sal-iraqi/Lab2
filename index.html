            <h3>Summary of the Day</h3>
            <p>
                I slept in this morning since I have been exhausted the previous days, always waking up early. 
                <br>Had breakfast and attended my lectures. 
                <br>Worked on homework until I held my tutoring session. 
                <br>My eyes were very sore and dry after a full day of screen time (downside of virtual life), so I practiced some music. 
                <br>I had dinner, watched some Naruto, and headed to sleep.

            <h3>Snippets About the Day</h3>
            While going through my media folder, I stumbled upon a video which demoed an FPS game I was working on during summer and have forgotten about. 
            <br>It was cool to look back at it. Maybe I'll get back to finishing it, but definitely not right now.

            <p>I watched almost all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/lbgcfpaoeek">8-hour freestyle stream</a> by my current favorite artist, Harry Mack. He freestyled 8 hours straight to celebrate his 800k sub count on youtube.
                <br> I also found this cool video, which absolutely blew my mind: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's a riddle I found:
                <br>
                <details>
                    <summary> How many times can you subtract the number 5 from 25? </summary>
                    Once, because after you subtract it's not 25 anymore.
                </details>
            </p>
